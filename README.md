* Increased transparency hampered people's ability to detect when a model had made a sizeable mistake. 
> Building interpretable machine learning models is not a purely computational model [...] what is or is not "interpretable" is defined by people, not algorithms.

Heo et al. [Fooling Neural Network Interpretations via Adversarial Model Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02041). In *NeurIPS 2019*. 

* Saliency interpretation methods can be fooled via adversarial model manipulation---a model finetuning step that aims to radically alter the explanation without hurting the accuracy of the original model. 

* More adversarial  examples:

Wiegreffe and Pinter. [Attention is not not Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04626). In *EMNLP 2019*.

* Deteching the attention scores obtained by parts of the model degredes the model itself. A reliable adversary must also be trained. 
* Attention scores are used as poviding an explanation; not the explanation.

Serrano and Smith. [Is Attention Interpretable?](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1282/). In *ACL 2019*.

Jain and Wallace. [Attention is not Explanation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1357/). In *NAACL 2019*.

> Attention provides an important way to explain the workings of neural models. 
> Implicit in this is the assumption that the inputs (e.g., words) accorded high attention weights are responsible for model output. 

* Attention is not strongly correlated with other, well-grounded feature-importance metrics.  
* Alternative distributions exist for which the model outputs near-identical prediction scores.

AÃ¯vodji et al. [Fairwashing: the risk of rationalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09749). In *ICML 2019*.

* **Fairwashing** is prooting the false perception that a machine learning model respects some ethical values. 
* This paper shows that it is possible to forge a fairer explanation from a truly unfair black box trough a process that the authors coin as **rationalization**.

Ustun et al. [Actionable Recourse in Linear Classification](http://www.berkustun.com/docs/actionable_recourse.pdf). IN **FAT 2019*.

* In this paper, the authors introduce **recourse**--the ability of a person to change the decision of the model through actionable input variables such as income vs. gender, age, or marital status.
* Transparency and explainability do not guarantee recourse.
* Interesting broader discussion:
    * Recourse vs. strategic manipulation.
    * Policy implications.

Chandrasekaran et al. [Do explanations make VQA models more predictable to a human?](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1128/). In *EMNLP 2018*.

* This paper measures how well a human "understands" a VQA model. The paper shows that people get better at predicting VQA model's behaviour using a few "training" examples, but that exisiting explanation modalities do not help make its failures or responses more predictable.

Feng et al. [Pathologies of Neural Models Make Interpretations Difficult](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1407/). In *EMNLP 2018*.

 * Input reduction iteratively removes the least important word from the input.    
 * The remaining words appear nonsensical to humans and are not the ones determined as important by interpretation method.
 
 Poerner et al. [Evaluating neural network explanation methods using hybrid documents and morphosyntactic agreement](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1032/). In *ACL 2018*.

  * Important characterization of explanation:   
  > A good explanation method should not reflect what humans attend to, but what task methods attend to.  
  * Interpretability differs between *small contexts* NLP tasks and *large context* tasks. 
  
 Kindermans et al. [The (Un)reliability of saliency methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00867). arxiv 2017.
 
 > Evaluating the reliability of saliency methods is complicated by a lack of ground truth, as ground truth would depend upon full transparency into how a model arrives at a decision---the very problem we are trying to solve for in the first place.
 
 *  A new evaluation criterion, **input invariance**, requires that the saliency method mirrors the sensitivity of model with respect to transformations of the input. Input transformations that do not change network's prediction, should not change the attribution either. 
  
 Sundararajan et al. [Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365). In *ICML 2017*.  
 
* **Implementation invariance**: the attributions should be identical for two functionally equivalent networks (their outputs are equal for all inputs, despite having very different implementations). 

* **Sensitivity**: if network assigns different predictions to two examples that differ in only one feature then the differing feature should be given a non-zero attribution.
 
 Das et al. [Human Attention in Visual Question Answering: Do Humans and Deep Networks look at the same regions?](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1092/). In *EMNLP 2016*.
 
 * Current attention models in VQA do not seem to be looking at the same regions as humans.
